# Food-530 dataset
This dataset contains in total **530** categories and **392,183** food images, including Chinese food, Japanese food, Western food, and so on. Food names are named in Chinese.

Food recognition is the key technology to automatic dietary assessment. Existing datasets for food recognition mainly contain Western and Japanese food, however, few Chinese food. In this project, we construct and release a new dataset called Food-530, which contains 392,183 food images from 530 categories, including Chinese food, Japanese food, Western food, and so on. This is currently the biggest Chinese food dataset.

The food categories are pupular dishes which were compiled from "Xinshipu". We collected food names from this website. Besides, we also collected data from [food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41) and [VireoFood-172](http://vireo.cs.cityu.edu.hk/VireoFood172/) and translated food names into Chinese. Food images were crawled from Baidu image search. Each category contains 500 to 1000 food images.
